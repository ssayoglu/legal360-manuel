# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# 📋 NEXT AGENT ACTION PLAN - DESIGN RESTORATION
# ===================================================

metadata:
  handover_date: "2025-09-06"
  handover_agent: "main"
  priority_level: "HIGH"
  estimated_effort: "2-4 hours"

## 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Restore the complex interactive design for process detail pages by fixing ProcessFlowWithHeader.jsx component import/export errors and enabling full functionality.

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS:
✅ WORKING: Backend (96.4% success), Admin panel, Homepage, Process list, Simple process detail
❌ BROKEN: Complex interactive process detail design due to React component errors
⚠️ SYMPTOMS: "Element type is invalid" errors, undefined component imports

## 🔧 REQUIRED ACTIONS:

### STEP 1: Debug Component Import Chain
- Systematically check all imports in ProcessFlowWithHeader.jsx
- Verify UI components (Button, Card, Badge) export/import syntax  
- Test Lucide-react icon imports individually
- Check Header.jsx, CostBreakdown.jsx, AdBanner.jsx components

### STEP 2: Fix Import Issues
- Resolve named vs default import mismatches
- Fix any circular dependencies
- Ensure all UI components are properly exported
- Verify Lucide-react icon syntax (current version: 0.507.0)

### STEP 3: Restore App.js Configuration
- Change App.js from ProcessFlowWithHeaderNew back to ProcessFlowWithHeader
- Test component loading without runtime errors

### STEP 4: Enable Interactive Features
- Step navigation (prev/next buttons)
- Calculator modals (hasCalculator integration)
- Cost breakdown modals (estimatedCosts display)
- Interactive step clicking for detailed view
- Proper icon rendering with gradient backgrounds

### STEP 5: Comprehensive Testing
- Test all process IDs: bosanma-sureci, is-davasi-sureci, ceza-yargisi-sureci
- Verify step navigation functionality
- Test calculator and cost breakdown modals
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes
- Validate all interactive elements work properly

## 📁 KEY FILES TO WORK WITH:
- /app/frontend/src/App.js (component routing)
- /app/frontend/src/components/ProcessFlowWithHeader.jsx (main complex component)
- /app/frontend/src/components/ProcessFlowWithHeaderNew.jsx (simple working version - reference)
- /app/frontend/src/components/ui/* (UI component library)
- /app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx, CostBreakdown.jsx, AdBanner.jsx

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS:
- If import errors persist, use troubleshoot_agent for systematic debugging
- Compare working ProcessFlowWithHeaderNew imports vs broken ProcessFlowWithHeader
- Test individual components in isolation before full integration
- Use browser dev tools to identify exact failing component
- Consider temporary simplification then gradual feature restoration

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS:
- `sudo supervisorctl restart frontend` after changes
- Test URLs: /process/bosanma-sureci, /process/is-davasi-sureci
- Use screenshot_tool for visual verification
- Check browser console for React errors

## 📈 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Process detail pages show interactive step navigation
✅ Calculator buttons work (if hasCalculator: true)
✅ Cost breakdown modals display (if estimatedCosts exist)
✅ Step clicking reveals detailed view with documents/notes
✅ Icons render properly with correct colors
✅ Responsive design maintains functionality
✅ No React runtime errors in console

PRIORITY: Restore rich interactive process detail experience that was previously working.
