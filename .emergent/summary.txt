The AI engineer successfully built the initial frontend for Legal Design Turkey, then transitioned to developing a comprehensive backend and an admin panel. This involved creating FastAPI endpoints, MongoDB models for dynamic content, and implementing JWT authentication. A significant portion of the work focused on building a WordPress-like React admin interface with full CRUD capabilities for legal processes, calculators, and blog posts. Numerous issues arose during frontend-backend integration, primarily related to environment variable access, routing, and data model mismatches, requiring extensive debugging and refactoring (e.g., introducing a  file). The latest efforts are focused on connecting the user-facing frontend to this new backend, replacing  data, with the current task addressing a component () still relying on old mock data.

<product_requirements>
The Legal Design Turkey application aims to simplify complex legal processes for citizens through an intuitive web interface. Initial requirements included a homepage, selectable process topics, mindmap/flowchart visualizations with step explanations, and citizen-friendly icons. Subsequent enhancements broadened the scope to include mobile-first responsive design, process-specific details (colors, duration, participants, documents, key points), hover tooltips, two specialized legal calculators (compensation and execution, both admin-updatable), case cost details, a legal aid information page, non-intrusive ads, a universal header with navigation, new content pages (About Us, Blog, Supreme Court, Contact), and advanced process filtering/search with lazy loading on the processes page, plus a homepage search. The current state has all these frontend features implemented and designed, ready for backend integration.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files & Changes:**
-   : Main React router, now includes protected admin routes. Was modified multiple times for authentication and routing setup.
-   : Modified to remove icons from navigation menus (desktop and mobile) based on user request.
-   : FastApi application. Updated to include new routers (, ), MongoDB connection logic, JWT setup, and CORS configuration.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Defines Pydantic models for all backend data entities (LegalProcess, CalculatorParameter, BlogPost, User, etc.), crucial for data validation and MongoDB interaction.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Implements JWT token creation, verification, password hashing, and user authentication logic.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Contains FastAPI endpoints for admin-specific operations like CRUD for legal processes, calculator parameters, blog posts, and mock data migration, secured by JWT.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Contains FastAPI endpoints for public-facing data retrieval (e.g., listing legal processes, blog posts).
-   : **NEW FILE**. Script to read  data and populate the MongoDB, used via an admin API endpoint.
-   : **NEW DIRECTORY/FILES**. These components form the entire admin panel.  handles authentication,  provides an overview and quick actions,  defines the admin UI structure, and  (among others) offers detailed forms for managing specific data types.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Centralized Axios instance for making authenticated API calls to the backend.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Custom React hook to simplify data fetching from the API, providing loading and error states.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Created to provide a consistent  after persistent issues with  in the frontend.
-   : Previously central for all frontend content, now being replaced by API calls. Modified to supply data for initial migration.
-   , , , , : These components were heavily modified to fetch data from the new backend API using  instead of .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate the  component to receive process data via props from its parent , instead of relying on .
-   Develop API endpoints and admin UI for managing Supreme Court Decisions, About Us, and Contact pages.
-   Implement file upload features for images/documents.
-   Introduce advanced form editors (e.g., WYSIWYG for rich text content).
-   Enhance search and filtering capabilities within the admin panel.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a massive effort to build out the backend infrastructure and an accompanying admin panel. This includes a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, featuring robust JWT authentication (admin/admin123), and comprehensive CRUD API endpoints for legal processes, calculator parameters, blog posts, and document descriptions.

On the frontend, a full React-based admin panel was created, mimicking a WordPress-like experience. This panel allows administrators to log in, view a dashboard, and manage legal processes through detailed forms that include fields for participants, required documents (with hover descriptions), important notes, and a calculator type selector. A mechanism to migrate initial mock data from  to the MongoDB backend was also implemented.

The current focus is on fully integrating the main frontend application with this new backend, moving away from . Several key frontend pages (, , , , ) have already been refactored to fetch data from the API using custom hooks and an API service.

Throughout this process, significant challenges were faced and overcome:
1.  **Authentication Issues**: Persistent problems with the admin login page being stuck or showing connection errors, primarily due to incorrect  configurations (switching between  and  domains) and backend import path errors. This led to multiple restarts and debugging using , , and console logs.
2.  **Environment Variable Handling**:  was repeatedly  in the React frontend, necessitating a complete shift from environment variables to a hardcoded URL in a new  file for reliability.
3.  **Data Model Mismatches**: Initial migration attempts failed because backend Pydantic models (e.g., ) expected a different data type than what  provided, requiring schema adjustments in .
4.  **Frontend Component Rendering**: Errors like Calculator is not defined were fixed by correctly importing icons, and data mapping issues (e.g., API field names vs. frontend expectations, emoji strings for icons, null checks for optional fields like tags) were addressed in .

The latest issue, immediately before this summary, is an error on the  page, specifically within the  component. This component, which is a child of  (already API-connected), is still attempting to import and use data from , causing a runtime error.

<optional_next_step>
Modify the  component to receive process data via props from  and remove its  import.
